# Portfolio
Week 1

 I learned the basics of HTML and CSS by reading all the information on this website: [Markdown](https://marksheet.io/).

 I implemented a lot of that information to make a small website with a prototype portfolio that I was going to use as the main portfolio. But I want to now make that website a playground to link to other projects for Javascript and React. As well as showcase the HTML and CSS tricks I learn along the way. The Website is located in "My Info". I wanted the website to have two columns of info, but the positioning knowledge for that kept alluding me. 

 On Sept. 9 I went to an ACM meeting at the behest of my Lab TA, Noah. There we were told the basics of HTML and CSS then some info on APIs and flexboxes. Flexboxes seemed exactly like what would solve my problem of positioning on my website, since I didn't want to just use a table format. Here is a recording of the [zoom meeting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZVD_rT8q0kRqZYIcIqI7DgunETMVr2oM/view?usp=sharing) and the [source code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZVD_rT8q0kRqZYIcIqI7DgunETMVr2oM/view?usp=sharing) for the bitcoin price finder they walked through during it.

 In my playground I created a flexbox in my footer. I used this website to learn about [flexboxes](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

 I've started this bootstrap [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_get_started.asp).

Week 2  

 I went through the introduction and tutorial for React [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). When I have access to a personal computer I will start making Chess.

 I followed the tutorial for [tic-tac-toe](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and I want to use some of the features such as move history and history shifting in the chess game I am working on. I'm not sure how to deploy it yeat, without using Netlify, but here is the [repository](https://github.com/stonex159/Tic-Tac-Toe)
 
 As of Sept. 14th I have remained forced to use github editor as my only editor as my computer has been decomissioned, not at my behest. This will be solved by Sept. 15th, but setting it up left me with only sept. 16th to do work. I will not have little to show next week.
 
 I want to make predictions appear depending on the piece you are currently controlling (have picked up) in the chess game. Implementing an ai opponent wil be too difficult for now, unless I find one for free use online. Looking at cursor manipulation and hover selectors should be the way. I found a page that can help [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/create-a-hover-button-in-a-react-app).
 
 In my one of my casual clubs I am an officer. I was talking with the other officers and the e-board about a better method of administrtion than leaving someone outisde to reord names and check marks. We decided on a google form, but I want to make a website because I think it will be fun and interesting since it is a bit more officila in capacity and must look presentable yet not formal. I'm having trouble with my commits from vscode not appearing in the git reposity for it. I think I'm missing a step, but it all seems right.
 
 I want to implement bootstrap throughout the club site but I am having trouble installing it through the terminal, unlike when I used a url in my playground site.
 
 I tried to create the chess game repository through the terminal but something went wrong and I think it corrupted. So I will have to make a new one, I will use vscode this time.
 
Week 3  

 I changed my club website into a react app, here is the [repo](https://github.com/stonex159/CVGC-Site) and the website is coming. Watching Dr. Bart's video on craeting a the TA Trainer was very informative and helpful as I setup the club app. I am trying to expand upon what I saw since my app is decidely different in application. I want people to input their name email and the status of their daily health check then submit that through a button. That info will them be stored and displayed in a table below that information collection column. When a new day passes that information will be moved over to the history page to be documented and referencable if contact tracing or attendance rate wants to be investigated.
 
 ~~Currently I having difficulties figuring how to make the form work as I am unfamiliar with forms in javascript. I've read some tutorials for them, like this [react/forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) and this [Data Tables in React](https://shopify.engineering/building-data-table-component-react) but the structure of my app is so different that I need to think about how I can implement them cleanly, or how to reorder my app.
 
 I have implemented a bootstrap form into my app, to gandle the collection of the information input.
 
 ~~Deploying the app to github pages is proving troublesome. I have followed [this](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f) article on how to, but I keep running into trouble at the "deploy": "gh-pages -d build" part. My code refuse to use that with my app's name.
