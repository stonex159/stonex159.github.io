# Portfolio
I learned the basics of HTML and CSS by reading all the information on this website: [Markdown](https://marksheet.io/).

I implemented a lot of that information to make a small website with a prototype portfolio that I was going to use as the main portfolio. But I want to now make that website a playground to link to other projects for Javascript and React. As well as showcase the HTML and CSS tricks I learn along the way. The Website is located in "My Info".

I originally wanted the website to have two columns of info, but the positioning knowledge for that kept alluding me. But On Sept. 9 I went to an ACM meeting at the behest of my TA Noah. There we were told the basics of HTML and CSS then some info on APIs and flexboxes. Flexboxes seemed exactly like what would solve my problem of positioning on my website, since I didn't want to just use a table format. Here is a recording of the [zoom meeting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZVD_rT8q0kRqZYIcIqI7DgunETMVr2oM/view?usp=sharing) and the [source code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZVD_rT8q0kRqZYIcIqI7DgunETMVr2oM/view?usp=sharing) for the bitcoin price finder they walked through during it.
