# Portfolio
Week 1
 I learned the basics of HTML and CSS by reading all the information on this website: [Markdown](https://marksheet.io/).

 I implemented a lot of that information to make a small website with a prototype portfolio that I was going to use as the main portfolio. But I want to now make that website a playground to link to other projects for Javascript and React. As well as showcase the HTML and CSS tricks I learn along the way. The Website is located in "My Info". I wanted the website to have two columns of info, but the positioning knowledge for that kept alluding me. 

 On Sept. 9 I went to an ACM meeting at the behest of my Lab TA, Noah. There we were told the basics of HTML and CSS then some info on APIs and flexboxes. Flexboxes seemed exactly like what would solve my problem of positioning on my website, since I didn't want to just use a table format. Here is a recording of the [zoom meeting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZVD_rT8q0kRqZYIcIqI7DgunETMVr2oM/view?usp=sharing) and the [source code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZVD_rT8q0kRqZYIcIqI7DgunETMVr2oM/view?usp=sharing) for the bitcoin price finder they walked through during it.

 In my playground I created a flexbox in my footer. I used this website to learn about [flexboxes](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

 I've started this bootstrap [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_get_started.asp).

Week 2
 I followed the tutorial for [tic-tac-toe](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and I want to use some of the features such as move history and history shifting in the chess game I am working on. I'm not sure how to deploy it yeat, without using Netlify, but here is the [repository](https://github.com/stonex159/Tic-Tac-Toe)
 
 I want to make predictions appear depending on the piece you are currently controlling (have picked up) in the chess game.
 
 I went through the introduction and tutorial for React [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). When I have access to a personal computer I will start making Chess.
 
  As of Sept. 14th I have remained forced to use github editor as my only editor as my computer has been decomissioned, not at my behest. This will be solved by Sept. 15th, but setting it up left me with only sept. 16th to do work. I will not have little to show next week.
